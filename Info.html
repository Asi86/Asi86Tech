     <br>This site is hosted using the free services github
     <br>offers along with a .com purchased from google domains.
     <br>All of the foundation code for this website was made
     <br>in Arcsoft's Website Builder. Almost all of the
     <br>original code was eventually scrapped and rebuilt
     <br>using a large amount of code from W3Schools.com. I
     <br>believe that the code from W3Schools.com is alot 
     <br>easier to read while not needing to have CSS code 
     <br>in a completly different file.
     <br>
     <br>The logo at the top left was made in Cadsoft Eagle
     <br>via trackpad. I had made the logo because I needed
     <br>some sort of watermark for a motherboard Ihad made.
     <br>
     <br>The Computer I used throughout the begining was a 
     <br>Low End Mac from Mid-2009 with 4gb ram, a core 2 duo
     <br>which was clocked at 2.53ghz, and a copy of 
     <br>DosDude1's patched MacOS Mojave
     <br>
     <br>Got any concerns or would like to email me?
