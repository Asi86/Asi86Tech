   <br>My name is Asiana. I do alot of computer stuff such as
   <br>thermal paste replacements on macbooks and desktops.
   <br>
   <br>I am able to do any macbook repair with litle to no issues as
   <br>long as it is in the year 2007-2013. I also do thermal 
   <br>replacements on alot of laptops
   <br>
   <br>My favorite accomplishment so far has been building an iPhone 5S
   <br>from the case up using parts off iFixit, Ebay, and Amazon.
   <br>
   <br>On this website, you will find all the intel Mac os X Install apps
   <br>along with some of my code and some terminal commands I've
   <br>collected over the years.I have also created a list of free programs
   <br>that are very helpful with IT work.
