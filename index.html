       <br>My name is <a href="Cat Zelda Theme.mp4" style="text-decoration: none; color:Black;" class="link">Asiana</a>. I do alot of computer stuff such as
       <br>thermal paste replacements on macbooks and desktops.
       <br>
       <br>I am able to do any part replacement for macbooks with
       <br>litle to no issues as long as it is in the year 
       <br>2007-2013. I also do basic matinence on alot of laptops.
       <br>
       <br>My favorite accomplishment so far has been building an iPhone 5S
       <br>from the case up using parts off iFixit, Ebay, and Amazon.
       <br>
       <br>Just recently, I started fixing and soldering PS2 Consoles,
       <br>and then proceeding to sell them after verifying that they
       <br>work. I also have been working on other consoles with my 
       <br>free time in Uni.
       <br>
       <br>On this website, you will find all the intel Mac os X Install apps
       <br>along with some of my code and some terminal commands I've
       <br>collected over the years.I have also created a list of free programs
       <br>that are very helpful with IT work.
